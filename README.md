## Techniques used, and why those techniques
I used Perlin noise, and I directly pull the vertices out.  That way I don't need to make a mesh with too high detail.  
The problem, however, is that the mountains don't look smooth.
## Instructions on building/assembling/etc. Also document how to run the code
Just go onto the link and it would run.  If you want to put on a headset / VR, then click the button
## When in VR mode, did you feel any motion sickness? Why and why not?
No because it moves in a straight line slowly.  
## What was the hardest part of the assignment?
The hardest part is to get the noise function to work while learning javascript from scratch.
## What do you wish youâ€™d done differently?
I should've waited on the noise function until after I learned more about it, and spend that time to learn javascript instead.
## What do you wish we had done differently?
The only thing is I don't have experience in Javascript so it was a huge struggle for me to understand scopes and
other basic information.  Thus it was overwhelming.  Maybe do more javascript tutorial or teach us about how to debug it 
would be helpful.
